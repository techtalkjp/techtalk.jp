> In October 2015, JapanTaxi CMO Kim Ko-eun and FreakOut Holdings Executive Officer Koji Mizoguchi were at a lunch meeting. It was intended to recruit a talented engineer from JapanTaxi. However, when that plan fell through, Mizoguchi ended up introducing his company's business instead. This eventually led to the establishment of IRIS, a joint venture handling digital signage business for taxis.
